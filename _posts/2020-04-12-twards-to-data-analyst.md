This post I share the courses/worships/recourses I'v followed or plan to. Two major gold for myself here: know how to do programming and analyze the scientific data with theses tools. make my scientific questions more impact.


# Programming
- [Advance Statistics in R](https://brightspace.ru.nl/d2l/home/17033), Radboud University, 2019.02

# Image analysis
- [Introduction to machine learning and using deepImageJ](http://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/) 2020.04
  - [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tmeXE2a8-1yau6DdYEl9hFuogBmajiss6py39MZ74wE/edit#slide=id.g6ee2a06502_2_69)
  - [Test images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17NXRSWfvaeYtg6qHxhKTmBtvTfN4MEGD)
  - [Code for training your own images](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bTbbAyUQHMTCQ7nR3nqjWMnRAXa3K5-j)
    - remark: this code use Tensorflorw to train image data, and return a model algorithm to analyse new data. The model algorithm can be used by combing with the deepImageJ interface.
  - [Ready to use algorithm and the deepImageJ plugin](https://deepimagej.github.io/deepimagej/index.html)
    - remark: one of the trained algorithm might be useful for fluorescence microscopy. [the paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0216-7)

# Plan
- [peer-learning community](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/) 
  - take course if interesting
- [Neuronal Dynamics From single neurons to networks and models of cognition](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/index.html)
  - read the book
  - watch the video
  - do the exercise (python)
